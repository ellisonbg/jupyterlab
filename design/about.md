# JupyterLab About Plugin

This document describes the design of the "About JupyterLab" plugin.

## User Tasks

Users should be able to:

* Learn how to get started using JupyterLab ("Scroll through tutorial")
* Easily close the page if they donâ€™t need it
  - *Mouse: Click to close*
* Show users (with visual animation) how to perform JupyterLab actions
  - i.e. Click and drag window tabs to move and split windows
* Not be intimidated by too many words ("About" should not feel like a commitment)
* Have an **overview** of tutorial contents on "Page 1" before scrolling
* Read/Take action at the end (similiar to launcher)
  - *UI: Clicking Action*
* Have a short description of JupyterLab capabilities
