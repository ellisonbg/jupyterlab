# JupyterLab Personas

This document contains a working draft of personas for JupyterLab.

For a reference on personas, see Alan Coopers, "The Inmates are Running the Asylum."

## Persona checklist

A persona is a detailed desription of a *specific* but *imaginary* individual user.

* A persona is described in a short paragraph.
* A persona should have a name.
* A persona should be specific and detailed.
* A persona should be precise more than accurate.
* A persona should be believable.

## A B

Jason Shu is a Data Scientist at Facebook. He has a B.S. in Computer Science from
UC Berkeley and has been working at Facebook for 2 years, mostly in Python, sometimes
in R. He works on small team of Data Scientists who work on a wide range of data
projects within the company. They all use the Jupyter Notebook regularly
and share notebooks internally on their team and with others in the company.
He primarily uses the open-source data science stack including Pandas,
Matplotlib, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, etc. While Jason has some experience
in doing more formal software engineering (version control, testing) that workflow
isn't a central part of his daily work. Jason works with many types of data including
CSV, SQL Databases, JSON and natural language.

# C D

C D is a sophomore Statistics major at Cal Poly who is pursuing a Data Science minor. He has
had taken CS 101/102 (Python) and Introduction to Statistics and knows the basics of the terminal
and bash shell. C has heard from classmates about git/GitHub, and started to read about it, but
has not started to use it yet. His first exposure to the Jupyter Notebook is in
Intorduction to Data Science, where is it used for all lectures, homework and pro

## Older Personas

### Ricardo Godfrey 

* Male 25, Full Stack Engineer

* Uses single notebook to explain a very specific topic or teach people something

    * Done with charts, graphs, tables (Matplotlib and Pandas), live code, images integrated in text

### Krista 

* Female 40, Engineering Professor

* Uses the Jupyter notebooks to teach her entire college courses

    * Done with Matplotlib graphs, & embeds in notebook, live code

# Personas
### Jason Shu
Jason Shu is a student majoring in computer programming. He has very basic knowledge of computer science and no knowledge of what Jupyter is.

**Goal:** Learn how to create new notebooks, open a new terminal, and change kernels

# Personas
### Jackie Lair
Jackie Lair is an experienced data scientist who is familiar with JupyterLab and uses it regularly. She uses the imagewidget to compare MRI scans alongside her code and write programs that outputs the information found in the MRI scans. 

**Goal:** To be able to manipulate images in JupyterLab to view alongside other tabs and support data analysis.

# Personas
### Janet Tobin 
An experienced data scientist with a graduate degree in a technical field and has been coding for more than 5 years in multiple languages. She is 35 years old, has a solid income, and lives in an urban setting. In the past she has used the Jupyter Notebook alongside a text editor (Sublime Text) and the Terminal app on a Mac. She loves to code and feels at home in a terminal.

**Goal:** Replace the usage of Mac's Terminal app, in particular when running Jupyter on a remote system.


# Personas
### William Shar 
William Shar is a high school student who has learned to code in his own time through taking codeschool classes. He was told about JupyterLab from his older brother and decided to try it out.

**Goal:** Utilize launcher as the main way to open new documents

# Personas
### Jane Gomez
Jane Gomez has never used the Jupyter Notebook before. She has some basic understanding of python, but only knows how to write simple functions. Sheâ€™s using the notebook for the first time in JupyterLab and wants to quickly learn how to use it.

**Goal:** Jane can quickly learn how to use the notebook through an intuitive menu bar and/or a tour.

### Shane Alborou
Shane Alborou has used Jupyter Notebook in a classroom setting in the past. He wants to use the multiscreen JupyterLab to write his code and submit it to his professor. 

**Goal:** The student can use all of the same functions that the Jupyter notebook has to turn in his code to his professor.
