# Design of the launcher plugin

This document describes the design of the launcher plugin.

# User tasks

Users should be able to:

* See the Launcher as the only open tab when JupyterLab starts
* Immediately open a document/activity of different types (click on icon)
  - Notebook
  - Terminal
  - Text editor
  - Console
* Open the JupyterLab Tour (button or link)
* Close the Launcher (x button)
* Reopen the Launcher if closed and have it be the active tab/panel (Jupyter menu, command)
* See the Launcher when they have multiple tabs open (it should be named “Launcher”)
